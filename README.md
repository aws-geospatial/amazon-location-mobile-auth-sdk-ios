# Amazon Location Service Mobile Authentication SDK for iOS

These utilities help you authenticate when when making [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) API calls from their iOS applications. This specifically helps when using [Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/authenticating-using-cognito.html) as the authentication method.

## Installation

1. Go to File -> Add Package Dependencies in your XCode project.
2. Type the package URL (https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-mobile-auth-sdk-ios/) into the search bar and press the enter key. 
3. Select the "amazon-location-mobile-auth-sdk-ios" package and click on "Add Package".
4. Select the "AmazonLocationiOSAuthSDK" package product and click on "Add Package".

## Usage

After installing the library, import the AuthHelper class in an activity:

``` swift
import AmazonLocationiOSAuthSDK
import AWSLocationXCF
```

You can create an AuthHelper and use it with the AWS SDK:

``` swift
// Create an authentication helper using credentials from Cognito
func exampleCognitoLogin() {
    let authHelper = AuthHelper()
    let locationCredentialsProvider = authHelper.authenticateWithCognitoUserPool(identityPoolId: "My-Cognito-Identity-Pool-Id", region: "us-east-1")
    let locationClient = authHelper.getLocationClient()
}
```

``` swift
// Create an authentication helper using credentials from any AWS-Swift-SDK Credentials Provider
func exampleCognitoLogin() {
    let authHelper = AuthHelper()
    let credentialProvider = try CredentialsProvider(source: .static(accessKey: "My-AWS-AccessKey", secret: "My-AWS-Secret", sessionToken: "My-AWS-SessionToken", shutdownCallback: {/*Perform post shutdown operation here*/})) 
    let customCredentialsProvider = AmazonLocationCustomCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider: credentialProvider)
    let locationCredentialsProvider = authHelper.authenticateWithCredentialsProvider(credentialsProvider: AmazonLocationCustomCredentialsProvider)
    let locationClient = authHelper.getLocationClient()
}
```
